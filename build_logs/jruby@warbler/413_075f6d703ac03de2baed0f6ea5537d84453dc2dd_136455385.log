if you want to use the executable lock_jars then install ruby-maven gem before using lock_jars 

   $ gem install ruby-maven -v '~> 3.3.11'

or add it as a development dependency to your Gemfile

   gem 'ruby-maven', '~> 3.3.11'

[32mPost-install message from rdoc:[0m
Depending on your version of ruby, you may need to install ruby rdoc/ri data:

<= 1.8.6 : unsupported
 = 1.8.7 : gem install rdoc-data; rdoc-data --install
 = 1.9.1 : gem install rdoc-data; rdoc-data --install
>= 1.9.2 : nothing to do! Yay!
