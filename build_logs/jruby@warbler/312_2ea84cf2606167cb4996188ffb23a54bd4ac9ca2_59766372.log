Deprecation Warnings:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The semantics of `RSpec::Core::Pending#pending` are changing in
RSpec 3.  In RSpec 2.x, it caused the example to be skipped. In
RSpec 3, the rest of the example will still be run but is expected
to fail, and will be marked as a failure (rather than as pending)
if the example passes.

Any passed block will no longer be executed. This feature is being
removed since it was semantically inconsistent, and the behaviour it
offered is being made available with the other ways of marking an
example pending.

To keep the same skip semantics, change `pending` to `skip`.
Otherwise, if you want the new RSpec 3 behavior, you can safely
ignore this warning and continue to upgrade to RSpec 3 without
addressing it.

Any passed block will no longer be executed. This feature is being
removed since it was semantically inconsistent, and the behaviour it
offered is being made available with the other ways of marking an
example pending.

To keep the same skip semantics, change `pending` to `skip`.
Otherwise, if you want the new RSpec 3 behavior, you can safely
ignore this warning and continue to upgrade to RSpec 3 without
addressing it.

If you need more of the backtrace for any of these deprecations to
identify where to make the necessary changes, you can configure
`config.raise_errors_for_deprecations!`, and it will turn the
deprecation warnings into errors, giving you the full backtrace.
